### **"MATE"**: Personalized Recommendation Engine  

**Project Vision**  
Our project, "MATE" is an intelligent recommendation engine designed to simplify decision-making for users by tailoring suggestions across various services, including restaurants, hotels, attractions, transport options, and local activities. By leveraging data on users' financial status, preferences, and specific needs, we aim to offer highly personalized recommendations that enhance their experiences and help them make informed choices effortlessly.  

**Our Approach**  
Weâ€™ve chosen to begin with **hotel recommendations** as the first use case for our project. This step allows us to establish a robust foundation for understanding user behavior and fine-tuning our recommendation algorithms. Our hotel recommendation system personalizes suggestions by taking into account:  

1. **Financial Status**: Adjusting recommendations based on the user's budget to ensure affordability.  
2. **Preferences**: Catering to specific user needs such as preferred amenities (e.g., free Wi-Fi, pool, spa).  
3. **Location**: Matching users to hotels near their desired location for convenience.  

**Why Start with Hotels?**  
Hotels are central to travel and tourism, where the need for personalization is critical. A well-optimized hotel recommendation system can serve as a strong entry point into the broader domain of service recommendations. This approach allows us to:  

- **Validate Our Framework**: Test our algorithms and personalization techniques in a focused domain.  
- **Gain User Insights**: Collect feedback and usage patterns to refine our methods for future expansions into other services.  
- **Showcase Tangible Impact**: Demonstrate how personalization adds value by helping users find their ideal stay effortlessly.
