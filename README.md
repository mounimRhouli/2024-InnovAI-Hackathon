# MATE: Personalized Recommendation Engine

## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement
In today's world, decision-making has become increasingly complex due to the sheer number of choices available across various services, from hotels and restaurants to local attractions and transportation options. Personalized recommendations can help users navigate these choices, leading to better experiences. However, many existing recommendation systems lack a deep understanding of the userâ€™s financial status, preferences, and specific needs, making the recommendations less relevant and effective.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
Our project, "MATE", seeks to solve this problem by building an intelligent recommendation engine that personalizes suggestions across different services. By analyzing users' financial status, preferences, and specific needs, we aim to deliver highly relevant recommendations that help users make more informed and enjoyable decisions. The system will start with hotel recommendations as a test case, providing users with personalized hotel suggestions based on their budget, preferred amenities, and desired location.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables
1. **Personalized Hotel Recommendation System**: A fully functioning recommendation engine tailored to the specific needs of the user.
2. **User Insights**: Data on how users interact with the system, which will guide future improvements.
3. **Extensible Framework**: The system will be designed to expand into other service areas (restaurants, attractions, transport) in the future.
4. **Documentation**: Clear instructions on how to set up and use the recommendation system.

Here are the next steps in a simpler format:


## Next Steps

1. **Build the MVP**  
   - Finalize the hotel recommendation system with essential features like budget, preferences, and location-based suggestions.

2. **Test with Users**  
   - Share the MVP with students, teachers, and schools to gather feedback.

3. **Add More Features**  
   - Enhance the system based on user feedback, adding more personalized options and improving the interface.

4. **Beta Launch**  
   - Launch the beta version to a wider audience and continue improving the system based on real-world usage.
