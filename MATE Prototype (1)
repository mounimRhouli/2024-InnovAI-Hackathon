By leveraging data on users' financial status, preferences, and specific needs, we aim to offer highly personalized recommendations that enhance their experiences and help them make informed choices effortlessly.  \n","\n","**Our Approach**  \n","We’ve chosen to begin with **hotel recommendations** as the first use case for our project. This step allows us to establish a robust foundation for understanding user behavior and fine-tuning our recommendation algorithms. Our hotel recommendation system personalizes suggestions by taking into account:  \n","\n","1. **Financial Status**: Adjusting recommendations based on the user's budget to ensure affordability.  \n","2. **Preferences**: Catering to specific user needs such as preferred amenities (e.g., free Wi-Fi, pool, spa).  \n","3. **Location**: Matching users to hotels near their desired location for convenience.  \n","\n","**Why Start with Hotels?**  \n","Hotels are central to travel and tourism, where the need for personalization is critical. A well-optimized hotel recommendation system can serve as a strong entry point into the broader domain of service recommendations. This approach allows us to:  \n","\n","- **Validate Our Framework**: Test our algorithms and personalization techniques in a focused domain.  \n","- **Gain User Insights**: Collect feedback and usage patterns to refine our methods for future expansions into other services.  \n","- **Showcase Tangible Impact**: Demonstrate how personalization adds value by helping users find their ideal stay effortlessly.  \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eDPGQlENM69I"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Next Step:**\n","\n","So, let’s get started and build our first use case: **hotel

Problem Overview:**\n","The goal is to build a hotel recommendation system that provides personalized hotel suggestions based on user preferences (e.g., pool, Wi-Fi), budget, specific needs (e.g., proximity to the city center), and **location**. We aim to minimize the **cold start problem**, ensuring the system can provide recommendations even for new users or items (hotels) with minimal data.\n","\n","#### **2. Input:**\n","For each user, the system will receive the following information:\n","- **Budget**: The user's financial capacity (normalized as a value between 0 and 1).\n","- **Preferences**: A list of preferences for the user, such as:\n","  - Pool\n","  - Wi-Fi\n","  - Pet-Friendly\n","  - Parking\n","  - Restaurant\n","  - Spa\n","  - Beach Access\n","- **Specific Needs**: A subset of preferences, such as proximity to the city center or near public transport (this could be represented as additional attributes in the dataset).\n","- **Location**: The user’s geographical location (city or region), which is essential for filtering hotels based on proximity.\n","\n","The **normalized budget** ensures that the recommendations respect the user's financial constraints.\n","\n","#### **3. Output:**\n","The system will return the **Top 3 Hotel Recommendations** for the user. Each recommendation will contain:\n","- **Hotel Name**\n","- **Price Per Night**\n","- **Location**\n","- **Rating**\n","- **Facilities** (e.g., pool, Wi-Fi, pet-friendly, etc.)\n","\n","The hotels will be ranked based on:\n","- **Price**: Respecting the user's budget (lower-priced hotels are prioritized).\n","- **Matching Preferences**: Hotels that best match the user's preferences (using content-based filtering).\n","- **Proximity to Needs**: Hotels that are close to the user’s **location** and meet the user's specific needs (e.g., proximity to the city center or specific facilities).\n","\n","#### **4. Recommendation Logic:**\n","To build the recommendation engine, we'll combine **location-based filtering**, **content-based filtering**, **budget constraints**, and **preference matching**:\n","\n","- **Location-Based Filtering**: Initially, filter hotels based on the user’s location (city or region). If no exact match is found, expand to nearby locations, such as neighboring cities or regions.\n","  \n","- **Budget Constraints**: After filtering by location, exclude hotels that exceed the user's normalized budget. This ensures that the recommendations are within the financial constraints of the user.\n","\n","- **Preference Matching**: For the remaining hotels, calculate a match score based on how well the hotel’s features align with the user’s preferences (e.g., pool, Wi-Fi, pet-friendly). This is done using binary encoding for preferences and comparing them with the hotel features.\n","\n","- **Ranking and Top 3 Recommendations**: Rank the filtered hotels based on a scoring system that combines:\n","  - **Price**: Prioritize cheaper hotels within the user’s budget.\n","  - **Preference Match**: Hotels with the highest preference match score are ranked higher.\n","  - **Proximity**: Hotels closer to the user’s location are prioritized.\n","\n","#### **5. Addressing the Cold Start Problem:**\n","The cold start problem arises when a new user or a new hotel has no prior data or interactions, making it hard for the system to generate personalized recommendations. To avoid this issue:\n","\n","- **For New Users**: User profiles are generated based on their initial input (e.g., budget, preferences, and location). In the absence of prior interaction data, the system relies on these attributes to provide recommendations.\n","  \n","- **For New Hotels**: Hotels without interaction data can still be recommended based on their **content-based features**. New hotels with detailed attributes (e.g., pool, Wi-Fi) are matched to user preferences using similarity measures.\n","\n","#### **6. Data Splitting:**\n","- **Training Set**: This will be used to train the recommendation logic, particularly to fine-tune the feature matching and budget normalization.\n","  \n","- **Testing Set**: This will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the recommendations, ensuring the system is performing as expected.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Steps of the Process:**\n","\n","1. **User Location Input**:\n","   - Prompt the user to input their location (e.g., city name or region). This is crucial for filtering hotels by proximity.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     user_location_input = input(\"Enter your location (e.g., city name): \")\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Filter Hotels by Location**:\n","   - Initially, filter the hotels dataset to include only those that match the user's location (e.g., city or region).\n","   - If no exact matches are found, search for nearby locations, such as neighboring cities or regions.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     filtered_hotels = hotel_df[hotel_df['Location'] == user_location_input]\n","     if filtered_hotels.empty:\n","         print(\"No exact matches found. Searching for nearby hotels...\")\n","         filtered_hotels = hotel_df  # Use all hotels if no exact match\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Apply Budget Filter**:\n","   - Once the hotels are filtered by location, exclude any hotels that exceed the user’s budget. Use the normalized budget to ensure the recommendations stay within the user’s financial constraints.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     filtered_hotels = filtered_hotels[filtered_hotels['Price'] <= user_budget]\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Match Preferences**:\n","   - For the remaining hotels, calculate how well each hotel matches the user's preferences (e.g., pool, Wi-Fi, pet-friendly, etc.) using **content-based filtering**. Each hotel will receive a score based on the number of matching features.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     def match_preferences(hotel, preferences):\n","         score = 0\n","         for pref in preferences:\n","             if hotel[pref] == True:\n","                 score += 1\n","         return score\n","     filtered_hotels['Preference_Score'] = filtered_hotels.apply(lambda x: match_preferences(x, user_preferences), axis=1)\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **Rank Hotels and Return Top 3**:\n","   - After applying the filters and preference matching, rank the remaining hotels by price, preference match score, and proximity.
